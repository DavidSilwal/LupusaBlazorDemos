# Lupusa Blazor Projects

At this moment there is available only **clock component**, next weeks/months we will add more components, small canvas based games and etc.

For now best performance has Firefox and Edge, please browse [demo](http://lupusablazordemos.azurewebsites.net) from them.

All activities, contributions are welcome, we're open for bussines/result oriented communication.

Our goal is to experiment blazor, acquire knowledge by doing wide spectre, practical projects, give accessibility on practical solutions for new **blazor citizens** and to develop blazor experience ready for fast moving in production.

We understand that today our code is wors than it will be tommorow :)

So this repo should be good example of fast grow and dramatically improvement in blazor frontend developments.

We call ourselves **Blazor Developers** and hope it will be 2019 trend and IT markets more and more requested specialization starting from end of experimental phase.
